The model was coded in the programming language Julia,  and solved using Gurobi as the MILP solver. The process described here developed to use UC Berkeleyâ€™s Savio cluster in order to tackle the complexity of running a large scale optimization problem for all the scenarios. 

The system was configured such that a problem dispatcher will assign to each one of the 27 aggregator models the respective data and spawn parallel solution processes. The implementation is shown in
