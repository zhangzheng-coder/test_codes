## Generic algotrithm for DP 

The type DP model is used to store the information of a one-state, one-control stochastic dynamic programming problem (SDP) with a random shock normally distributed. The solution process assumes that in every function the control is the first argument
in the functions.

See the comments inside ```dp_solver.jl``` for details.
