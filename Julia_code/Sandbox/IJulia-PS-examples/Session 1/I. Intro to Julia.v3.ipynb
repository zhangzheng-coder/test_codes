      "Six months ago I was running MATLAB on Windows with a student license. The more I read about research workflows, the more convinced I became that there were better ways to go. This past summer I decided to explore many of the tools I was reading about, and it transformed the way I do my research work. Today I run Python and Julia on Ubuntu Linux. Here's why I chose Julia.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Three reasons I chose Julia\n",
      "1. The [JuMP][8] Julia package effectively replaces the thirty-year-old [AMPL modeling language][3]. \n",
      "<!-- I use JuMP macros to build QP models and pass them to any capable solver. JuMP is actively developed: when a few researchers in my area requested chance constraints as a feature, the JuMP team added it in. (When my project progresses into chance-constrained optimization in the future, JuMP will be ready to go.) -->\n",
      "\n",
      "2. [Julia is fast][2].\n",
      "3. Julia syntax is natural for MATLAB users. It supports `[a b; c d]` matrix concatenation. It has many MATLAB functions like `sort`, `setdiff`, `unique`, `sparse`, and even `spy`. When you tell it to invert a matrix (using the same `A\\B` syntax MATLAB uses), it [figures out the best algorithm][1] to use. **You can begin writing Julia code using MATLAB style and gradually mix in Julia tricks as you go along.**\n",
      "\n",
      "Nice side benefits: no more watermarks, nothing proprietary.\n",
      "\n",
      "## My experience so far\n",
      "Although learning any new language is rocky at first, I have already found myself doing things I could not have done with my former tools. One example is transmission network visualization: I can use Julia and [Graphviz][4] to programmatically generate a rich SVG representation of a power network.\n",
      "\n",
      "The [IPython notebook][5] made my transition easy. When I first contemplated switching from MATLAB, I was intimidated by the command line. I couldn't find a comfy, MATLAB-esque development environment for Julia. How could I give up side-by-side script and output or the variable workspace? IPython/IJulia notebooks are the answer. A notebook consists of cells. Each cell can be a header, a markdown cell (which can include $\\LaTeX$ equations, bullet lists, and tables), or a code cell. When you write and execute a code cell, its output (whether it be a matrix, some text, or a chart) is displayed inline, so the notebook is self-contained and flows nicely. When you are finished creating a notebook, you can [export it in a variety of formats][6] including HTML and $\\LaTeX$.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are [a bunch of example notebooks][7] that demonstrate what you can do; they are a great way to learn. The notebooks we will go through here are more domain-specific, and I hope they are helpful for power system researchers. In this session we will consider the following research workflow:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Formulate an optimization problem in $\\LaTeX$.\n",
      "2. Import data from a MATLAB `.mat` file (using Julia's MAT package to generate a set of Julia variables).\n",
      "3. Use JuMP to solve the optimization problem.\n",
      "4. Perform a series of checks to make sure the output makes sense.\n",
      "5. Plot the results.\n",
